# Welcome

Welcome to my portfolio, this portfolio consists of different projects, applications, and things I have set up within my personal home lab for both personal usage and learning purposes.

I have created guides/tutorials and overviews of each of these to understand why I chose it and also to inform you about what it is exactly I'm using.

On the next page, you will see a table of content that will redirect you to the corresponding place.
