# Tautulli

Tautulli is a 3rd Party program that can be run along side a plex media server to monitor activity and various tasks. Most importantly, these statistics include what has been watched, who watched it when and where they watched it, and how it was watched. All statistics are presented in a nice and clean interface with many tables and graphs, which makes it easy to analyse data about your server.

Here is what the main homepage looks like:
