# Plex Media Server

## Overview:

Plex is a media streaming service that is client-server side based, in contrast to your traditional streaming platforms like Netflix or Stan. Plex is a self-hosted client and can be used to host/stream the media content you own at home already. The plex software creates a convenience to allow any of your media to be easily streamed to any devices that the plex software supports, within your network or even outside your own home.
