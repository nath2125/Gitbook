# Follow Up Settings

Before we get into the follow-up settings, I should advise you have a quick look at this [tips and tricks article](https://imgur.com/a/QAUFN13) made for plex. It's quite easy to follow and probably best to make these changes. You might find some stuff in the article overlap, which is fine you can just skip it.

You want to be making sure for optimal streaming quality that the "video quality" is set to maximum and tick the play smaller videos at original quality. These settings will also need to be adjusted to the same per device and user/account since it will be a preference setting to you alone and everyone else will by default have the preset default settings selected.

## <mark style="color:red;">Plex Dashboard</mark>

Plex dashboard is where all the general information about what is going on with your plex media server is going to be. Information about current real-time media being played/streamed, stats about bandwidth, CPU, ram, storage, stats on user viewing, and most viewed content.

## <mark style="color:red;">Remote Access</mark>

Remote access is where the configuration for sending/allowing your media to be viewed outside of your network/house. Normally this is preconfigured and by default will be able to work out of the box, once enabled by the plex server owner.&#x20;

Sometimes there may also be problems where it can't reach outside the network. That's when you may need to configure port forwarding with plex on your home network router and or also configure a specific port also if you would like. That part is optional (Manual Port) since plex already has predefined port numbers can you can just enter them into your port forwarding rules on your router.
